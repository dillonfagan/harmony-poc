# Harmony (Proof of Concept)

Merchants of all shapes and sizes are hampered in today's economy by exorbitant credit card transaction fees. Consumers everywhere are noticing special discounts for cash payments or explicit credit card fees, which most hadn't seen for several years. Worse still, these fees are accrued by large, multinational corporations like Visa and Mastercard, whose profits far exceed the utility they provide. Meanwhile, credit card users face soaring interest rates that lock many in endless cycles of debt that only federal legislation, it seems, could ever resolve.

At the same time, communities are fighting to build local wealth. Fighting to create a cushion that can be passed down from generation to generation. But, the land beneath their feet continues to be pulled out from under them, to become corporate chains, expensive rental properties, or unused lots for speculation. All at the expense of the common person.

We need democracy, dignity, and sustainability, but the system in which we live deprives us of those needs. We're forced to beg politicians, make concessions to corporate interests, and strike in order to have a voice. We deserve better and a better future is possible.

**Harmony** is a participatory platform for everyone. It's a new payment system and the beginnings of a new economy that will grow within the shell of the old one.
